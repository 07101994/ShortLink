# ShortLink

This is a simple demo version of a link shortener. It is a quick, easy way to get started with serverless and Azure Storage. 

Read the walkthrough article: [Azure Serverless for Serverless .NET in Minutes](https://jlik.me/cox) for step-by-step instructions, explanations, and links to documentation.

See the full, production version of this project [here](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/serverless-url-shortener).

## TL;DR; 

`git clone https://github.com/JeremyLikness/ShortLink.git`

Open `ShortLink.sln` with Visual Studio 2017 15.5 or later (must have the Azure workload selected).

Hit **F5**.
